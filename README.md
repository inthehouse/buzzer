Project description
\
\
The code consists of a simple reaction test.
\
&nbsp; ● You have four different regions:
\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ Spring (green, top left)
\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ○ Summer (yellow, top right)
\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ Autumn (orange, bottom right)
\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ○ Winter (blue, bottom left)
\
&nbsp;● Randomly one of the fields is colored in the corresponding color of the season
\
&nbsp;● The user clicks on one of the seasons
\
&nbsp;● Once the user has clicked a field inform the user on how long they took and if they
clicked on the right season, then the next season is colored
\
&nbsp;● The idea behind the test is to measure how fast users select the season, how big their
error rate is and how it develops over time
